# AI Landing Page Generator Feature

## Overview

The AI Landing Page Generator is a powerful feature that uses AI (Claude) to automatically create beautiful, conversion-optimized landing pages for your SaaS ideas. Simply describe your product, and the AI researcher agent will generate a complete landing page with all the essential sections.

## Features

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

The `todos` table stores all tasks:
- `id`: Primary key
- `user_id`: Owner of the task
- `team_id`: Team context (nullable)
- `title`: Task title
- `description`: User's SaaS idea description
- `type`: Task type (landing_page, research)
- `status`: Current status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- `result`: Generated HTML or research results
- `metadata`: Additional data (tokens used, errors, etc.)
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

### API Integration

The feature uses Anthropic's Claude API:
- Endpoint: `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`
- Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (configurable)
- Max tokens: 4096 for landing pages
- Timeout: 60 seconds

### Components

- **Model**: `App\Models\Todo`
- **Service**: `App\Services\ResearcherAgentService`
- **Livewire**: `App\Http\Livewire\TodoManager`
- **View**: `resources/views/livewire/todo-manager.blade.php`

## Best Practices

1. **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide comprehensive details for better results
2. **Specific Features**: List 3-6 concrete features
3. **Target Audience**: Clearly define who the product is for
4. **Value Proposition**: Explain the unique benefit
5. **Review Output**: Always review and customize generated content
6. **Save Favorites**: Keep successful generations for reference

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude API key not configured" Error

**Solution**: Add your API key to `.env`:
```env
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Task Stays in "Processing" Status

**Possible Causes**:
- API timeout
- Invalid API key
- Network issues

**Solution**: Click "Retry" or check your API key and internet connection

### Generated Page Doesn't Look Right

**Solution**: Try providing more specific details in your description, or regenerate the task

### Can't See the Menu Item

**Solution**: Ensure you're logged in and the navigation menu has been updated

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing the Prompt

Edit `app/Services/ResearcherAgentService.php` to modify the AI prompt:
```php
private function buildLandingPagePrompt(string $description): string
{
    // Customize the prompt here
}
```

### Adding New Task Types

1. Update the `type` enum in the migration
2. Add handling in `ResearcherAgentService`
3. Update the Livewire component validation
4. Add UI options in the form

### Extending Metadata

Store additional information in the `metadata` JSON column:
```php
$todo->update([
    'metadata' => [
        'model' => 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
        'tokens_used' => 2048,
        'custom_field' => 'value',
    ],
]);
```

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in environment variables (never in code)
- User authorization checks on all todo operations
- Team isolation (users only see their team's todos)
- Input validation on all user inputs
- CSRF protection on all forms
- SQL injection prevention through Eloquent ORM

## Performance

- Async processing recommended for production (use queues)
- Cache frequently accessed todos
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Consider pagination for large todo lists

## Future Enhancements

- Queue-based background processing
- Email notifications on completion
- Export to various formats (PDF, HTML file)
- Template library for common SaaS types
- A/B testing variations
- SEO optimization suggestions
- Analytics integration
